I have not inlcuded the python import files. Those packages can be found on https://pypi.org/, this can be done manually or with the use of Thonny manage packages.

bat file will need editing, use your own python 3.11 folder and location for Integrate.py file

Shortcut for Promail.bat will need to be recreated, use logo2 as icon.

Keep the files in the same folder or directory.
